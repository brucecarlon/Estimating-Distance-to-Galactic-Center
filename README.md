# Estimating Distance to Galactic Center

We will use variable stars, type II cepheids to estimate the distance to the Galatic center. We calibrate a Period-Luminosity (P-L) relation using cepheids in the Large Magellanic Cloud, get their absolute magnitudes then use that calibrated P-L to get the absolute magnitude and hence their distance to the ones close to the center of the Milky Way

Data obtained from OGLE-III survey
